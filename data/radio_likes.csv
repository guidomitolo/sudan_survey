2353,,
2354,,
2355,,
2356,Get to learnt,"Lost frequency some time ,no power"
2357,,
2358,Let our learners be educate over radio,"No power , radio broke down sometime and no enough power"
2359,We learn a lot of things all over the world,"When the battery is low
Power
Lost of frequency sometime"
2360,,
2361,,
2362,Getting to learn,"Low frequency
Lack of power for radio"
2363,,
2364,I mostly like about education,Power and lack of radio
2365,,
2366,,
2367,,
2368,Maths and English,Lack of power and frequency

2373,Lessons,No enough radios
2374,,
2375,To listen other things,Power and low frequency

2426,Because radio can give you extra information,"1. If you are not a quick listener.
2. Language especially for lower primary.
3. Timing.
4. If you don't have a radio."
2427,,
2428,Because there are additional information from the radio,"1. Calculation of math is a problem
2. Speedy of lacture.
3. no assignment
"
2429,,"1. You can not ask questions

2486,New information about the school,You will miss some topics
2487,,
2488,English,No text book
2489,,
2490,,
2491,I like radio lessons at my home compound,"Sometimes MTN and Zain network are reliable, community conflict effect of Civic 19 ,flooding issues and lack of school meals"
2492,"Lessons happened at my coumpound, that's mean less walking and less time to worry about going to school.","1.Communal conflict
2. Lack of Government formation
3. I find it hard to report to the governor "
2493,Study at home at my own pace!,"Time frame, hard to ask question during lessoning"

2495,,
2496,,
2497,,
2498,,
2499,,I have no radio

2534,To get more inflation ,"Lack of phone ,poor net works "
2535,To get information ,Lack of radios 
2536,It keeps me busy,Teacher are very fast

2551,,Little time is given for the lessons and poor listening skills 
2552,,
2553,,
2554,,
2555,News that keeps us informed of what is going on in country,"No power for radio, poor Network"
2556,,
2557,,
2558,,
2559,Because the facilitators/teachers give quizes or exercise and the learners participate in the lesson.,There is no interaction with the learners and sometimes the pronunciations are not clear and the teachers are too fast.
2560,,
2561,,
2562,Because the facilitators/teachers are clear and the lessons are interactive.,When does not practically view or see the expressions of the teacher and sometimes the teachers are too fast.
2563,,
2564,,
2565,Because some of the lessons are a revision and therefore makes one to understand and not forget what has been taught.,Some of the facilitators do not pronounce the words clearly and sometimes speak very fast.
2566,Because at the end of the lessons there is always some exercise.,Difficult pronunciations and sometimes they are very fast.
2567,,
2568,,
2569,,
2570,,
2571,Because the teachers are clear and they sometimes teach things that are not taught to us.,There is no room for one to interact with the teacher.
2572,The teachers give exercise and also they interact with the learner's.,The teachers is not seen that is to say he is very far and pronunciations of the teachers are sometimes difficult.
2573,,
2574,,
2575,,
2576,,Timing is not appropriate for all learner's and the absence of visualizing subject teachers for subjects like mathematics is a challenge as it does not cater for slow learner's.
2577,,
2578,Some of the lessons taught have not been taught in the school.,Lessons like maths are not practical and the pronunciations are not so clear and can not be understood.
2579,,
2580,They are educative and I do benefit alot from the radio program.,Sometimes there is failure in the signal.
2581,,
2582,,Some of the subjects that are supposed to be practical are taught while one does not see the teacher and secondly the lessons do not take into account slow learner's.
2583,They are very educative and makes one to remember what one has learned before.,The radio lessons are not interactive and some times when there is a failure in signal the whole lesson is interrupted and hence the same lesson can not be repeated the following day.
2584,,The radio lessons do not give an opportunity for one to ask questions and also do not cater for slow learner's.
2585,,
2586,It reminds me of things that I have forgotten,"When battery is low
Only for science student"
2587,We cover some new topics not taught in school,There was not enough time for learning
2588,,
2589,,
2590,,
2591,The flow of explanation over the radio is good ,Poor listeners will not pick the content and most presenters are faster that most students will miss some of the points
2592,Good pronunciation over radio is good ,Lack of radio for individual student to attend the radio
2593,Updates about the country,"Other people have no radio at home ,   some presentor are faster that you could no listen well."
2594,Social studies,Lack of power

2660,,
2661,"What is not said during lessons, you can still get from the radio","Yes, there are challenges; time limit, poor network, sources of energy and inadequate radios at home"
2662,,"There is no time to ask the question, the coverage is very less, poor network and lack of radios at home."

2667,,"Time for broadcasting is limited, network is poor sometimes"
2668,,Radio lessons are lacking  a lot of things for example with some subjects like pysic which need drawing can not be broadcast
2669,,
2670,The radio lessons remind us about the school,"Limited time for broadcasting, when you call the number is always busy,etc"
2671,,There's poor explaination with the radio lessons and one you can ask for help
2672,,
2673,,

3555,,
3556,,
3557,,
3558,,
3559,,
3560,,
3561,,
3562,,Because  most time the Learners are taken up by other duties during the lessons like domestic work
3563,,
3564,,
3565,Because of apprapate information,Getting dry cell is not easy
3566,It help learner's keep update on school program,"Speed of instructor, lack of attention by learner, signal jumping, power source "
3567,I like mostly English,The speed is very first
3568,It can remain us of what we wanted to forgot,The time is less
3569,,One of the challenges is maths because it needs practice
3570,,I can't understand it well
3571,I like the way they are conducting,Because it's not real practice

3593,,
3594,"Listening skills is acquired.
Knowledge is also acquired on radio programs",Noise in the backgrounds as some environments are not conducive for learning on radio.
3595,I listening mathematics,"Most people do not have radio 
Some learners do have access to use radio"
3596,,
3597,Science and English lessons,"Learners have no time listen and have no access to radio.

4622,The teaching,Congestion in asking and answering questions
4623,Because the teachers once they introduce a new topic I immediately rush to get it from the books.,The time is limited to cover the topics.
4624,It keeps reminding me since I have taken long at home because of schools closure.,"It's sometimes difficult to understand what is being taught and when it comes to answering questions, it's difficult as the radio line will be congested."
