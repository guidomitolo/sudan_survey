,
,
,
,
,

,
,
,

,
,
,
,
,

,
Because after teaching he can still revise the notes he has taken during the lessons.,No challenge given by the learner
,
So that I develop school culture and remind us of old lessons gained,"If don't understand, you can't ask the presenter to repeat for you "
Get updates about the country as a whole.,It difficult to ask questions when ever you did not get well and those one without radio will have no access at all.
It educates every body as you attend to it especially those who left school long time ago.,"Network coverage some times affect them especially when you want to get clarification from the moderator, network could not allow."
,
,
,
,
Because it is one way of preventing coronas but when schools reopen pupils will get lesson from their teacher.,No challenge he has so far registered.
,
,
,
Clear explanation from the moderators .,No challenge she has got from lessons over radio
,
,
,

,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,

Improving my knowledge ,No asking back questions 
,
,
,No questions time and answering given
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Because it gives lesson to the entire learner's and public at large,Language and distancing when ever you want clarification there is no enough time given for elaboration on the topics
I like the way teachers teaches,Limited time available and no wider coverage
,
,
,
,The speed use by teacher will not let the slow learner learned
Simple explaination,Difficult in understanding
,
,
,No radio
,
,
,Difficult to understand
,
Easy to understand,Lack of radio at home
Reduced the rate of exposure.,Students can't as questions and not all have radios

,
Cheaper,"Speech of the teacher, network problem and unavailability of radios"
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Is not giving me a chance to ask a call a teacher

Good explanations by the presenters,"Access to radios, no one to explain to the lessons to the learners, and no phone"
I like the way it is presentation,"No, challenges"

Songs,Sometimes radio may break down.

,
News that keeps us informed of what is going on in country,"No power for radio, poor Network"
,
,
,
Because the facilitators/teachers give quizes or exercise and the learners participate in the lesson.,There is no interaction with the learners and sometimes the pronunciations are not clear and the teachers are too fast.
,
,
Because the facilitators/teachers are clear and the lessons are interactive.,When does not practically view or see the expressions of the teacher and sometimes the teachers are too fast.
,
,
Because some of the lessons are a revision and therefore makes one to understand and not forget what has been taught.,Some of the facilitators do not pronounce the words clearly and sometimes speak very fast.
Because at the end of the lessons there is always some exercise.,Difficult pronunciations and sometimes they are very fast.
,
,
,
,
Because the teachers are clear and they sometimes teach things that are not taught to us.,There is no room for one to interact with the teacher.
The teachers give exercise and also they interact with the learner's.,The teachers is not seen that is to say he is very far and pronunciations of the teachers are sometimes difficult.
,
,
,
,Timing is not appropriate for all learner's and the absence of visualizing subject teachers for subjects like mathematics is a challenge as it does not cater for slow learner's.
,
Some of the lessons taught have not been taught in the school.,Lessons like maths are not practical and the pronunciations are not so clear and can not be understood.
,
They are educative and I do benefit alot from the radio program.,Sometimes there is failure in the signal.
,
,Some of the subjects that are supposed to be practical are taught while one does not see the teacher and secondly the lessons do not take into account slow learner's.
They are very educative and makes one to remember what one has learned before.,The radio lessons are not interactive and some times when there is a failure in signal the whole lesson is interrupted and hence the same lesson can not be repeated the following day.
,The radio lessons do not give an opportunity for one to ask questions and also do not cater for slow learner's.
,
It reminds me of things that I have forgotten,"When battery is low
Only for science student"
We cover some new topics not taught in school,There was not enough time for learning
,
,
,
The flow of explanation over the radio is good ,Poor listeners will not pick the content and most presenters are faster that most students will miss some of the points
Good pronunciation over radio is good ,Lack of radio for individual student to attend the radio
Updates about the country,"Other people have no radio at home ,   some presentor are faster that you could no listen well."
Social studies,Lack of power

,"Understanding is difficult, short time of broadcasting, most of the students do no have radio, lack of energy sources and the network problem also."
,
"What is not said during lessons, you can still get from the radio","Yes, there are challenges; time limit, poor network, sources of energy and inadequate radios at home"
,"There is no time to ask the question, the coverage is very less, poor network and lack of radios at home."
,
,"The challenges are that most people are not used to radio, poor network, poor coverage"
,"We don't know time lessons broadcast, the way lessons are being broadcast is not that convincing etc"
,
,"Time for broadcasting is limited, network is poor sometimes"
,Radio lessons are lacking  a lot of things for example with some subjects like pysic which need drawing can not be broadcast
,
The radio lessons remind us about the school,"Limited time for broadcasting, when you call the number is always busy,etc"
,There's poor explaination with the radio lessons and one you can ask for help
,
,
,
I like English,Limited time for broadcasting
I do really enjoy their explanation,"You can't ask the question, you can't reverse what has been explain etc"
I like the the way lessons are being broadcast,"Lack of radios, limited time for broadcasting, sources of energy among others"
,
,
,
,
,
Give time to ask questions,One side favour
,You don't asked questions like mathematical lesson
,"Some time radio signal maybe bad
Not easy to ask question"
Good introduction in lessons,"Low understanding
Limited time"
,
,Difficult to ask question
,
,I don't have radio
,"Higher speed
Limited time that is thirty minutes only"
,Radio lesson are not demonstrate as class room lessons
,You can't ask questions
,
,Short period for delivery of lesson
Correct interpretation of lessons being tough,Learners have no radios
,"Limited time, lack of personal radio"
,
,
Many callers makes it easy to understand,"Lack of radio
Out coverage"
,No Link between the learners and the Teacher over radio
Radio presentations,It does accommodate all type of learners 
,No radios
,
,
,
,
,
,The program is not covering all areas
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Poor signal
,The program itself is not good
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Because they give good lesson to learner's,Radio break down for some time
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Teaching methods and spellings.,Time not enough.
The teaching is good but time not enough.,Teaching time not enough.
Science subjects.,Lack of radio at home.
,
Teaching method and the way they ask questions.,lack of radio some times and limited time.
It's give additional information,"The is that, most of the people don't have radios and also the issue of power"
,
,
It is because the lessons are very excellent,No comment
Radio lessons are so participatory,There are no practical work
Because l learn new thing ,No practical work and time limit
,
Listening and taking notes help practice,Lessons are read faster than needed radios are not enough
,
,
This train us how to listen and take notes,Rushing when giving lectures make no time for questions
Listening gives skills of understanding,Lack of radios and rushing speed of the lectures
Listening to mathematics lessons,Power of radio and speed of radio lectures
,
English,Radios are not enough for Learners and radio and accent of teachers use be difficult
,
Listening to the teacher at my home,Shortages of radios and learning materials eg books
,
,
,
Because I do have chance to question,Network issue
It's give me more information,Power
,
,The presenter don't repeat even if a learner has no understood the content.
,Hard to understand lessons which you don't see the person who is teaching 
I am liking the most important lessons ,Difficult to ask questions 
Good expectations,If a child is alone is very difficult to understand
,"If the battery is weak you can't concentrate,  Maths lessons needs to done as you are seeing practically. And in some home there is no radio for one to attend to "
,
,
To understand more,Sometimes network problem 
,
Becouse if the good teaching ,Difficult to ask 
,
,
Is like I am in the class , If I don't listen it is impossible to recall again 
,
It helps the learners to maintain their passed knowledge ,No problem
It keeps one to recalled lessons that were taught by teachers in the class,The radios are not available in all the villages for the people
Updates of the country will be got through radio,Learners are not getting the explanation better than what the teachers are giving in the class
Getting updates about the country ,No radio in most homes as such some people don't have access for it 
,
,
Explanation is better and very clear,"When the battery is low you can't listen to the radio,  if the participant has poor listening then he she will no get the content properly"
It keeps children not to for get what they have been taught ,She can't listen to radio always because she didn't have one at home
,
,
,
So that i get new ideas,Less time for explanation
Because it teach me for my class subject,Teachers are very fast in explanation
So that i get more news and new vocabulary,Network problem
So that i get news,Poor network
So i get knowledge,The  Teacher are very fast
So that i get new knowledge,Very fast
New things,Network problem
It give me and my kids busy,Very fast
I get new information and it keeps me busy,Some time if there no sun light.
,
It keep the children busy,Very fast
It keep my kids busy,Network problem
It helps the learners to learn from home,The program does not cover all the learners
,The program don't capture all learners
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
English,No materials like learning aids
English and math,Sometime Radio can not work
English maths science,We don't have textbook to follow the teacher
,
English,No text books 
Maths science,Sometimes radio is not working
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Because radio lessons are keeping our learner busy with their study ,One of challenges is went the power of the battery is off before the lessons or in the middle of lessons
Because it's keeping me with news ,Because if the battery got off at the middle of lesson this is really challenges 
,
,
,
,
Because it's keeping us to updated our knowledge and also keeping student busy to attend their lessons ,One of the challenges is that is lesson is on going while the battery should got off in the middle of lessons
,Sometime the explanation and partice are form teacher are difficult to understand
,
Because it's keeping me busy to gain knowledge through radio ,Sometime the channel are very poor 
Because it's keeping me busy to attend the lesson ,Poor channel 
Because it's keeping me to attend my lessons,Poor channel
Because it's always bring the lessons that I do miss it ,Battery is the most challenges
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Practical teaching with clear demonstration for some one to understand.,Little package been cover compare to what teachers are giving you in classroom
It keeps us informed,No radio
,I'm not getting something
,
,
They keep me updated,Engagement in other activities and radio
I gives good knowledge to those who left school long time ago,It goes faster
,
,
,
,U can't ask question because there is no network in the village here.
I like it because it is the same lessons which are taught in the at school,The issue of power
,
,
Because I get information which are not yet taught in the school on the radio lessons,You listen but you will not see the teacher
,
,I don't know
,It something new to me
,
,
,
,
,
,It can be interrupted
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
I like listening,Network issue
The lessons for science is very clear over the radio ,Miss spelling and sometime when you want to  concentrate you will get the lessons moved ahead 
Clear explanation from the teachers in the studio.,"No teacher infront of the child.
Sometimes a child can move out to go and drink water at that moment he or she will.miss the point "
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,I don't know
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
To get more information ,"Poor net work ,lack of radio "
To get more ,No challenges 
To get more ,Lack of air time 
,
,
,
,
,
,
,"Air time ,no radio ,poor net work "
,
To add more knowledge ,"Teacher is hurry ,no radios ,no air time "
To add more information ,"Present of teacher ,capability of listening is the challenges ,it does not covered the whole areas ,lack of radios ,poor not works "
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Because gives me more information,It will be difficult for those who are weak in listening
,"I don't, know "
,
,
,
What I like most I'd the time lessons are being broadcast,"Limited time for broadcasting, some time lack of power, poor network some, lack of radios among others"
,"Limited time for broadcasting, lack of radios, sources of power are limited and poor network"
,
,
,
Radio lessons engage us alot during the period of Covid 19,"Some time no power in the phone, limited time for broadcasting, lack of radios at home"
,Because they are not well elaborated 
,
,
,
,
,"Challenges are; no physical presentation of a teacher, limited time for presentation, no time for asking questions by students."
,
,
What I like most is the way the are broadcast,"Sources of power, limited time for broadcasting, many people don't have radio"
," The illustration is not there for subjects which needs illustration, limited time for broadcasting, lack of sources of power etc"
,
,
,
,
,
,
To add more ,"Lack of radios ,lack of air time ,"
,
Created interest in following teacher,People around interfere during radio lesson
It is the only mean of learning during covid 19,Difficult to understand and interact with the Teacher
,Difficult to understand mathematics
No very much but it only mean available,Asking question is difficult
,Difficult to asks questions during the lesson
It the only mean of learning during covid 19,"Lack radio, timing for learners to open radio late, it very passed"
,Power difficulty some time
How the teach,Note writing and network are most chellanges that facing us.
No more walking because of coronavirus ,"Not everybody have radio at home, learners control is poor and there is no note taking during lessons"
Reduce congestion because of coronavirus ,No face to face contact between learners and teachers during lessons
,"No note taking, no proper learning, no homework, no face to face learning."
It past information,The issue power
,
"There are no enough radios in the community, if the radios were enough it would be a good means of learning","Lack of radios, children don't sit to attend the radio programs"
,
,It is good for those in the universities
,They are not helping our children
,"Lack of radios, hardship in understanding the new teachers on radio compared to their classroom teachers"
,
,
,
,
Nothing,"Language, lack of radios"
They are good but it would be better to involve our local radio stations and even the teachers,"High cost of purchasing a radio,there will be no way to complete the syllabus, other students I.e ART students are not catered for"
,
,
The time management,You don't see the practical formula
It makes you to learn what you don't know,What is being aired can not be compared to what is written on the blackboard
,
English,Sometimes they don't have time to narrate for you some additional knowledge
,There is no practice
,There is no practice
,
,
,
,Lack if enough practice
,Poor time management by both the teacher and pupils
,
,
,
,
,
,Because the period for lesson is very short
I get more information on the radio,The only challenge was i did not see the words on the radio intern of spelling
,Sometimes no charger at home
,Luck of radio is a big challenge facing me and my children at home
I used to listen and learn more information on the radio,Luck of network when you call the Teacher in the studio for the Question.
,
,
,
,
,
,Sometimes the signal is not clear and they don't have enough time to answer it Question
,No radio no good time
,
,
,
,Time frame was not enough to study
,No good example through radio program
,
,
,"No good signal sometimes they don't as you about questions,"
,
,
Mathematics,"Sometimes u may not started on time due to other activities that may not allow u to attend, lack of radio"
,
It gives me information,Poor network is not enabling us to ask questions
,
,
,
,
It keeps someone informed,There is no way for asking question
,Nothing
,
,
,
,
,
,
Only English lesson,Some time There's no power in my phone because I using phone in that case I miss lesson
,
,
,
,
,
Most is English,Most of parents don't have radio at home
,
,
,
,
,It's not good
Listening to English lesson,Radio clear like lesson in school
,It doesn't accommodate all my colleagues
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
I do get right pronounciation ,We don't have facilitators 
,
Explaination is loud and clear,Lack of radio and batteries
"Updates of what is going on in the country
",Some time is difficulty to understand due to poor listening skills
Updates of country,Provision of radios to vulnerable people in the community
Keep our children busy and develop culture of school,It doesn't cover all the areas especially in rural locations
Explanation was in details ,You can't asked questions if you don't have air time to call the present or 
Covid 19 Awearnes,Some times the person talks too fast then the learner does not understand
,
The Knowledge,Different lessons from theirs
English,Some times when there is no dry cells on the radio
,
If he missed to come to school the he can listen from the radio,No means ofcommunication
She understands better,There is difficulty when there is no radio
,No radio
,You can't do calculation if maths lessons
,
Because they are teaching all the subjects for the children with clear explanation.,"Lack of radio to all the households , some family are not educated so they could not understand since the lessons are taught in English and they can't even explain more to their children."
,Some presenters are teaching so faster that pupils can't get very well compare to lessons in the classroom
,Subjects like math's can't be calculated
,
,
,
,
,
,Time variety
The school children can get more information on the website and internet,The time you need to get more information on the radio  is very first
 Radio coverage is very good for children in school because it can pass information to the students, Many students do not have enough time to listen to the school program and less time for them
Activated learner's to perform well in their academy year,The are short time  because learner's can not ask many questions 
Separate class,"Most of students don,t concentrate"
If I know the time I can follow., I don't know time for starting radio lessons
,
,
Have no time to listen,Power off
,
Interaction with teachers,Lack of Radio
Interaction with teachers,Lack of battery
,
,
Most of the things I was not aware about them I for it during radio lessons ,"Difficult to ask questions.
No phone calls to recall back "
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Because it's updated me with news ,Poor channel and poor network
Because it's keeping me with latest and news ,Poor channel and poor network
,
,
,
,Most of learner's don't have radios
,
,
,"No power, no radios"
,
,Difficult to understand.
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
English and science,Sometimes interrupted by visitors
,
,
,
I do listen a home to radio lessons and easy to understand.,Sometimes network coverage is hard to make radio lessons operate on air .
To listen to new information over the radio about the world.,Lack of radio is one of the challenges and small children could not manage to cope up with listening over the radio lessons.
,
It has taught me so many things about the world and education.,No
,
,
It has been reaching me about education lessons on air.,There is no anything difficult.
English and Maths.,Spelling of words is hard.
,
,
It is teaching me many things about the world.,Pronunciation and spelling of words.
English.,Spelling of words.
Maths,Pronunciation is a problem.
It teaches me new information.,Spelling of words and pronunciation.
To update me with new information.,Nothing.
Science and Maths.,No
I do listen to radio lessons all the time.,Nothing is challenging.
,
To update us about the education system and CoVID 19 caused.,It's not easy for some learners to understand radio lessons.
,To understand the radio lessons is not easy.
,
,
,
,
It's educative and informative about health.,Break down of Radios.
,
They are often on air .,Some subjects are sometimes difficult to be understood by me.
,
The radio lessons are interesting and good for me.,There are challenges like explanation of some words and pronunciation.
The things that I listened to over the radio lessons.,Nothing challenging over the radio lessons.
,
Because of new updates about the world things.,Nothing is challenging.
,
To get news all over the world.,There are no challenges.
,There are challenges like no radio at homes sometimes.
,
,
They are good for me all times.,Nothing.
,
,They are not enough for me to learn more things.
,
,
We learn more things about education on air.,Some people don't have radios such that they listen to all times.
They are more helpful and educative to our community.,No.
,
Teaching about CoVID 19 preventive measures and radio lessons.,"The challenges are pronunciation, spelling and break down of the radio system."
,
,
,
,
,
,
Well explained,Radio lessons there no physical contact
,
More information about the school,The time is too short
Learning programme,The waves can not receive well.Power shortage
Get more information about the school,The time is limited
,
,
,
,
,
English lessons are interactive,"
When there is no power in the phone"
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Some time help improve language,Some difficult words you cannot ask for explanation
Language specially the pronunciation,It better than staying but radio lesson are not.Like the classroom teaching because yo u can't follow the teacher
It improve my communication skills especially the English,Problems of understanding some the language is hard to understand
,
,
It encouraged me to revised my book,"Some subjects needs to be taught in the classroom by the teacher such as maths,and chemistry physics"
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Timing is very hard
English,Sometime we doesn't know the time of lessons
,
,
,
,
,No airtime to call to ask questions
,No Questions of clarification for learners
,No time for asking Questions because many are calling at the same time
,
,Voice on radio differ and the speed
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Lessons.,Nothing to ask questions.
,very heard to understand
to get news,hard to understand
gave me lesson at home,hard to understand
Encourage and give hope of school,Some question are not understood and no way to call for more explaination
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
Because they elaborate in detail,Most families don't have radio
because it keeps us learning.,when there is no radio we can not attend.
,
,
,
,I don't understand
,
,
More revision  on some subjects.,Some subjects are aren't taught.
,
,
,
,No clear explanation.
,It's conducted in English with out local language
,No proper explanation of the lesson.
They teachs very well,Power
Because they offer quality lessons,"Network, telephone broke down, inactive teacher in and hardly reachable when asking questions."
,
,
,
,Sometimes the signal has problem
,
,
,
,
,
Easy to understand and has no different with our usual lessons ,Learner's should not ask the question they do not  understand due to time limit 
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
,Very hard to follow. 
,
,No radio at my home
,We don't have radio at home
,They don't repeat whenever one has no understand well.
,
Good expectations ,The way he is explaining is very hars to understand

,
,
,No teachers 
It's  food to understand ,"Difficult to ask questions
Low battery "
,
,
,
,No asking questions 
Good explanation ,Distribution of radios 
,
,
Maths,Time is not enough
,
Science and English,No marking for exercise no revision
,No questions asked
,
,Poor communication between teacher and students
It keep me informed,Most of our learners may not get because of poor language
,
,
It remained me about what I have forgotten,There is poor communication between teacher and the learner of which a child can't ask question.
,
I like cr Lessons.,I don't listen radios everyday.
,
Because my favorite subject is science,The time is not enough
Science,Is hard to understand
,
,
Things are taught there Qualified teachers who simplified the lessons for learners to understand easily,When you don't see something You may not understand easily and I am used to face to face teaching
,The challenges  teaching on the rodio children can't gets what they wanted
,
,
,It's not good
,
Because I get more information,"When you miss a word no, nobody will repeat for you"
I like listening some times,"We missed physical appearance of the teacher and no, chance for asking questions"
Because I get some new information,I miss some words some times and no repeatation
,
,

Because of covid_19,If broken I'd difficult to repair
I like this lesson on air,There is no challenges
Because it will save my healthy,Due to radio difficulties
Get extra knowledge from it.,"Maths is hard for children to understand, some time power goes off,and net work coverage."
English language help in improving my language,"1. Interrupt domestic work
2. Some of the term are hard to understand."
,Find some siblings make noise
Getting  new knowledge from the teaching on the radio,Network problem some them when calling the station
It engaged one to be busy with studies after doing domestic work,Sometimes net work problems
,Sometimes it is hard to understand some words
,
,
,Lack of radio
,
,

,"No radio,    it is difficult to perceive the lessons over radio by the children."
The presenters are loud and clear that every body can understand ,Absence of radio for her to attend to and the coverage of radio is not in all locations.
,
,
Radio is good because I do listen at my free place ,There are a lot of inconvineince 
,
,
,
,
,
,
You use it for news,I'm following any lesson on radio
,
Because is clear and brief,Radios are not available and the electricity

Because of apprapate information,Getting dry cell is not easy
It help learner's keep update on school program,"Speed of instructor, lack of attention by learner, signal jumping, power source "
I like mostly English,The speed is very first
It can remain us of what we wanted to forgot,The time is less
,One of the challenges is maths because it needs practice

Spelling 
How to construct sentences"
,
,
,
,
,

The way the teachers explain things.,There is no physical contact with the teachers handling the lessons.
Teaching of maths because of the teacher,You only listen but you don't see
The teaching,Congestion in asking and answering questions
Because the teachers once they introduce a new topic I immediately rush to get it from the books.,The time is limited to cover the topics.
It keeps reminding me since I have taken long at home because of schools closure.,"It's sometimes difficult to understand what is being taught and when it comes to answering questions, it's difficult as the radio line will be congested."
,When there is no radio at home you may not have lessons from the radio and subjects that involve calculation are difficult to understand.

,It's not possible to ask the teachers since I don't have mobile phone and with learning certain things need to be practica
,
,
It brings back memories of school as if am in the class.,The teaching is fast as teachers hurry to finish their lessons which sometimes make learners not get certain things.
The repeatition to make us get the lessons well.,You don't see the person teaching physically and asking questions is another problem.

,
,
,
The teaching that keeps me remember other things I have forgotten.,The time is short and sometimes no access to the radio lessons when there's no power.

Gain more knowledge,Sometimes not very clear
,
More educative,Sometimes the waves are not clear
Educative issues,Sometimes radio is broken
,

,
,
More awareness,Sometimes not very clear
Issues concerning education,Radio lessons are not practical
Enjoying the teaching,Sometimes not very clear
We learn more from the radio program,Radio lessons are not practical

The organised teaching,Sometimes the timing is not favourable for me
More educative,Sometimes the radio get spoil

,No radio at home and I can't listen all the time
